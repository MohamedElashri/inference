Welcome to Allen's documentation!
=================================

Allen is the LHCb high-level trigger 1 (HLT1) application on graphics processing units (GPUs).
It is responsible for filtering an input rate of 30 million collisions per second down to an output
rate of around 1-2 MHz. It does this by performing fast track reconstruction and selecting pp collision events based on one- and two-track objects entirely on GPUs.


This site documents various aspects of Allen.
