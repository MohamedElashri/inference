"""Load all available configuration from a test repository, use them
to configure Allen and in turn dump Allen's configuration to a JSON
file. Then compare the configuration dumped by Allen to the original
TCK and check that they are identical.

This ensures that no properties are changed after they are set and a
round trip of load configuration, configure Allen, dump configuration
does not alter any properties as a side effect of configuration or
persistence.
